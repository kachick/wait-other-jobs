## How to update path for each extensions of devcontainer.json?

Just get from Nix shell as follows.

```console
> which dprint
/nix/store/2rmr7ybmnr5xdcy6sw1073p0j5ljgw0n-dprint-0.37.1/bin/dprint
> which hadolint
/nix/store/3gl6j30ak4n692vfs5l1rsqf07pdr429-hadolint-2.12.0/bin/hadolint
```

I want to realize better integration, but I don't know it.
