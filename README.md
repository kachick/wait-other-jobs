This action waits all GitHub Action jobs even if they are running in other workflows.\
When some jobs failed, this action exit with NON 0 value. Otherwise exit with 0.

I mainly use this action for below use-case when they should run after multiple CI workflows

- [Deploy to Firebase/Vercel/Netlify](https://github.com/kachick/convert-color-json-between-windows-terminal-and-vscode/blob/1a8eac43be819204ff21eec1198fd2dfad3fcaa3/.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml#L39-L43)
- [Release with GitHub releasing](https://github.com/kachick/asdf-cargo-make/blob/a666005e239cfd2b78d43e462e6279e8d8ab4d3d/.github/workflows/release.yml#L12-L16)
- [Auto approve and merge dependabot PRs without PAT(Personal Access Token)](https://github.com/kachick/ruby-ulid/blob/ad4c6090d7835d80ff02a1a5f57d6e9ae11a85d3/.github/workflows/merge-bot-pr.yml#L21-L26)
- [Auto approve and merge renovatebot PRs without `platformAutomerge` feature](https://github.com/kachick/ruby-ulid/blob/ad4c6090d7835d80ff02a1a5f57d6e9ae11a85d3/.github/workflows/merge-bot-pr.yml#L46-L50)

# Usage

Just requires `github-token` for minimum configuration.\
I recommend to use `timeout-minutes` together with.

```yaml
jobs:
  with-waiting:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Wait other jobs are passed or failed
        uses: kachick/wait-other-jobs@v1
        timeout-minutes: 15
        with:
          github-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
```

You can adjust status polling interval and turns early-exit as below.

```yaml
with:
  github-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
  min-interval-seconds: '300' # default '30'
  retry-method: 'equal_intervals' # default 'exponential_backoff'
  early-exit: 'false' # default 'true'
```

Below is a typical usecase. Assume test jobs defined in another workflow.

```yaml
name: Merge bot PR after CI
on: pull_request

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  # checks: read # For private repositories
  # actions: read # For private repositories

jobs:
  dependabot:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]' }}
    steps:
      - name: Dependabot metadata
        id: metadata
        uses: dependabot/fetch-metadata@v1.3.6
        with:
          github-token: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Wait other jobs
        if: ${{steps.metadata.outputs.update-type != 'version-update:semver-major'}}
        uses: kachick/wait-other-jobs@v1
        timeout-minutes: 10
        with:
          github-token: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
      - name: Approve and merge
        if: ${{steps.metadata.outputs.update-type != 'version-update:semver-major'}}
        run: gh pr review --approve "$PR_URL" && gh pr merge --auto --squash "$PR_URL"
        env:
          PR_URL: ${{github.event.pull_request.html_url}}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}

  renovate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ github.actor == 'renovate[bot]' }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Wait other jobs
        uses: kachick/wait-other-jobs@v1
        timeout-minutes: 10
        with:
          github-token: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
      - name: Approve and merge
        run: gh pr review --approve "$PR_URL" && gh pr merge --auto --squash "$PR_URL"
        env:
          PR_URL: ${{github.event.pull_request.html_url}}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

# GITHUB_TOKEN vs PAT

This action just requires following GITHUB_TOKEN permissions. Needless annoying setup and needless unsecure around PAT.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  checks: read
  actions: read
```

I used a way to comment `@dependabot merge` in past. This is simple to ensure CI passed.\
However it requires PAT(Personal Access Token).\
[PAT could't be reduced the permission scope to repository.](https://github.community/t/limiting-scope-of-a-pat-to-a-single-repository/3129)\
And it requires annoy steps to generate, sets and maintains tokens [even if refined with beta version](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-18-introducing-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens/).

This action provides another way. It checks other workflows/jobs statuses in actions with GITHUB_TOKEN.

# Why avoid `automerge` and `platformAutomerge` provided by renovate official?

`automerge` is slow. `platformAutomerge` requires many repository settings.

When you feel no issues around that, do not need to migrate to this action.\
It requires many changes in repository settings around `Allow auto-merge`, `Require status checks to pass before merging` and **specify the checked workflow name**.\
Especially specifying mandatory CI names in all personal repositories are annoy task to me.\
If we are talking only about organizations, [hashicorp/terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) might resolve it easier.

## Cons

- [Above merging logics are written in GitHub official docs](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/914134b5c7d10ceb19a50919b267480fd1ad55f1/content/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/automating-dependabot-with-github-actions.md#enable-auto-merge-on-a-pull-request). However [GITHUB_TOKEN merged commit does not trigger new workflows even if defined as "push"](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/914134b5c7d10ceb19a50919b267480fd1ad55f1/data/reusables/actions/actions-do-not-trigger-workflows.md?plain=1#L1). So the badges will not be shown in commit history of default branch :<
