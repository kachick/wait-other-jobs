This GitHub action waits for all or specific jobs, even if they are running in other workflows.\
If any of those jobs fail, this action will fail as well.

## Usage

Zero or tiny configuration may work.

```yaml
jobs:
  your_job:
    # Enabling these permissions are required in private repositories
    # permissions:
    #   contents: read
    #   checks: read
    #   actions: read
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: kachick/wait-other-jobs@v3.0.0
        timeout-minutes: 15 # Recommended to be enabled with your appropriate value for fail-safe use
```

You can change the token, polling interval, allow/deny list and turns early-exit as below.

```yaml
with:
  github-token: "${{ secrets.YOUR_PAT }}"
  wait-seconds-before-first-polling: '30' # default '10'
  min-interval-seconds: '300' # default '15'
  retry-method: 'exponential_backoff' # default 'equal_intervals'
  early-exit: 'false' # default 'true'
  skip-same-workflow: 'true' # default 'false'
  # lists should be given with JSON formatted array, do not specify both wait-list and skip-list
  #   - Each items should have "workflowFile" field and they can optinaly have "jobName" field
  #   - If no jobName is specified, all of jobs in the workflow will be targeted
  wait-list: |
    [
      {
        "workflowFile": "ci.yml",
        "jobName": "test"
      },
      {
        "workflowFile": "release.yml"
      }
    ]
  skip-list: |
    [
      {
        "workflowFile": "pages.yml"
      }
    ]
```

## Required GTHUB_TOKEN permissions

In public repositories, they are satisfied by default

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read # Since v2
  checks: read
  actions: read
```

## Examples

I'm using this action for auto-merging bot PRs and wait for deploy.\
See the [docs](docs/examples.md) for further detail.

## Limitations

- If you use this action in multiple jobs on the same repository, you should avoid deadlocks.\
  The `skip-list`, `wait-list` and `skip-same-workflow` options cover this use case.

- Judge OK or Bad with the checkRun state at the moment.\
  When some jobs will be triggered after this action with `needs: [distant-first]`, it might be unaccurate.\
  (I didn't see actual example yet)

- If any workflow starts many jobs as 100+, this action does not support it.\
  Because of nested paging in GraphQL makes complex. See [related docs](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-paginate-graphql.js/blob/a6b12e867466b0c583b002acd1cb1ed90b11841f/README.md#L184-L218) for further detail.
